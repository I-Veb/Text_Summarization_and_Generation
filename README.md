# Article Summarization and Text Generation with Python

This project focuses on developing advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities for text summarization and predictive text generation. It leverages Python, LSTM neural networks, pre-trained transformer models, and tokenization techniques to provide powerful text processing functionalities.

## Features

1. **Article Summarization Module**:
   - Developed a summarization module using Python libraries such as `bert-abstractive-summarizer` and `summarize`.
   - Trained the model from scratch and benchmarked its performance against state-of-the-art pre-trained transformers like BERT, GPT 2, Pegasus, and XLNet.
   - The module adeptly condenses lengthy articles into insightful summaries, enhancing readability and accessibility.

2. **Next Word Prediction Model**:
   - Built a Next Word Prediction model using LSTM neural networks tailored to a domain-specific dataset.
   - Implemented tokenization techniques for text preprocessing to accurately predict subsequent words and improve language modeling capabilities.
   - This module enables predictive text generation, facilitating seamless communication and content creation.

3. **Comprehensive Text Processing Application**:
   - Integrated both models to develop a multitask and comprehensive text processing application.
   - Seamlessly merges the functionalities of Article Summarization and Next Word Prediction, providing a versatile tool for text analysis and generation.

## Usage

1. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
   - Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Article Summarization**:
   - Use the provided functions or API endpoints to summarize articles.
   - Benchmark the performance against various pre-trained transformer models.

3. **Next Word Prediction**:
   - Train the LSTM model on your dataset or use the pre-trained model provided.
   - Generate predictive text using the trained model.

4. **Comprehensive Text Processing Application**:
   - Utilize the integrated application for both article summarization and next word prediction tasks.
   - Explore the combined functionalities to analyze and generate text efficiently.
